# Vim: An Exciting New JS IDE

## 60-second Vim Tutorial

1. Vim is a modal editor
2. The two modes you need to know today are *normal* and *insert*
3. From *normal* mode, enter *insert* mode by pressing `i`
4. From any mode, return to *normal* mode by pressing `esc`
5. In *insert* mode, you can edit text as you're used to
6. In *normal* mode, you enter commands by prefixing them with a `:`
7. save current buffer with `:w <filename>`
8. If the file is already named, you can save with just `:w`
9. If the file is saved, exit vim with `:q`
10. If file is unsaved, but you would like to exit anyway, `:q!`
